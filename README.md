## Assignment
In this assignment we were asked to put the contents of our Python-API-Challenge into a website hosted by GitHub Pages.

## Approach
To complete this assignment, I used Bootstrap as the control template for HTML formatting. There are 7 pages total in this website. A landing/home page, a comparison page, a data page, and four pages dedicated to their corresponding plots. The data page required a table to be displayed from the contents of the CSV generated during the Python-API-Challenge so I wrote a quick Python script to convert the CSV into an HTML table. Afterwards I was able to paste this HTML into the Boostrap table control.

## Notes
I learned that specifying the paths for HTML pages and assets is different when developing them vs deploying them.
